## Some of my stuff

### Pomo-Todo
[Github Repo](https://github.com/naznsan/pomotodo)  
Pomo-Todo was the first project I did while learning React. I worked on it back when funcitonal components and hooks were still in beta, so it's a little outdated now.  
It taught me the basics of working with a framework such as React, as well as using services like Netlify to host the apps that I made.

### Footprint Podiatry
[Link coming soon...]()  
Footprint Podiatry is a local podiatry clinic that I am currently developing a website for, using Gatsby and React.  
During the process of developing this website, I am learning a lot about freelancing, and communicating with a client, as well as how to design a website for a specific client.  
I hope to be able to complete it soon, and also learn about how to host a site in a VPS, along with connecting it to a domain.
