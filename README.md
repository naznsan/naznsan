### Pomo-Todo
[Github Repo](https://github.com/naznsan/pomotodo)  
Pomo-Todo was the first project I did while learning React. I worked on it back when funcitonal components and hooks were still in beta, so it's a little outdated now.  
It taught me the basics of working with a framework such as React, as well as using services like Netlify to host the apps that I made.
