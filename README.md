# 👋 Justin Kim's Profile

I'm a Web Developer based in Auckland, NZ.

At the moment I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Microsoft.

I'm interested in software and web development, mainly in the frontend side of things.

In my spare time I like to read, build plastic models, or go the gym.

## 🔎 Some of my stuff

### Pomo-Todo
[Github Repo](https://github.com/naznsan/pomotodo)  
Pomo-Todo was the first project I did while learning React. I worked on it back when funcitonal components and hooks were still in beta, so it's a little outdated now.  
It taught me the basics of working with a framework such as React, as well as using services like Netlify to host the apps that I made.

### Footprint Podiatry
[Link to Site](https://footprintpodiatry.co.nz/)  
Footprint Podiatry is a local podiatry clinic that I am currently developing a website for, using Gatsby and React.  
During the process of developing this website, I am learning a lot about freelancing, and communicating with a client, as well as how to design a website for a specific client.  
I am currently in the process of adding some final edits, cleaning up the layout here and there.

### Aleph Tav Studios
[Link to Site](https://alephtavstudios.com)  
Aleph Tav Studios is a local art and illustrations studio that I am developing a website for, using NextJS and React.  
During the process of developing this website, I am learning about working with NextJS, optimizing larger images, and implementing other people's designs into my work.  
I am currently in the process of optimizing the load times of images, as well as SEO.
