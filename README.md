# üëã Justin Kim's Profile

I'm a Web Developer based in Auckland, NZ.

At the moment, I'm doing some freelance work while studying for my Postgraduate Diploma at the University of Auckland.

I'm interested in software and web development, mainly in the frontend side of things.

In my spare time I like to read, build plastic models, or go the gym.

## üîé Some of my stuff

### Pomo-Todo
[Github Repo](https://github.com/naznsan/pomotodo)  
Pomo-Todo was the first project I did while learning React. I worked on it back when funcitonal components and hooks were still in beta, so it's a little outdated now.  
It taught me the basics of working with a framework such as React, as well as using services like Netlify to host the apps that I made.
