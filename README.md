# Justin (Junghyun) Kim

## üë¶ About Me
My name is Justin and I am currently working as a software developer in Auckland, NZ.
At the moment, I'm mostly working on backend services that will be used in medical environments for automated transcriptions with voice recognition.

I consider myself a very outgoing and social person, and strive in collaborative environments where I can work with others to find efficient solutions to challenges.

In my spare time, I like to read or work with electronics and my 3D printer to create sometimes janky hardware solutions to various problems I might have.
I also enjoy staying active by going to the gym, going on long treks, or playing tennis with my mates.
