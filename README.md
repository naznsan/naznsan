# 👋 Justin Kim's Profile

I'm a Web Developer based in Auckland, NZ.

At the moment, I'm doing some freelance work while studying for my Postgraduate Diploma at the University of Auckland.

I'm interested in software and web development, mainly in the frontend side of things.

In my spare time I like to read, build plastic models, or go the gym.

## 🔎 Some of my stuff

### Pomo-Todo
[Github Repo](https://github.com/naznsan/pomotodo)  
Pomo-Todo was the first project I did while learning React. I worked on it back when funcitonal components and hooks were still in beta, so it's a little outdated now.  
It taught me the basics of working with a framework such as React, as well as using services like Netlify to host the apps that I made.

### Footprint Podiatry
[Link coming soon...]()  
Footprint Podiatry is a local podiatry clinic that I am currently developing a website for, using Gatsby and React.  
During the process of developing this website, I am learning a lot about freelancing, and communicating with a client, as well as how to design a website for a specific client.  
I hope to be able to complete it soon, and also learn about how to host a site in a VPS, along with connecting it to a domain.
